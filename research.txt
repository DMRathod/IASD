intent aware service delivery
Assumption : intent is known


example : navigation as service 

example of an intent : route with fuel station 


framework : 1-edge layer, 2-fog layer, 3-cloud layer


edge layer =  service provider, serivce consumers
fog layer =  service provider
cloud layer =  service provider

provider with service, datacontext
consumer with intent, service request


edge layer with clusters
fog layer with fog nodes as cluster head
cloud layer with datacenters


cluster is constructed based on a metric or a neighbourhood defined with the help of 
1) physical distance(region) between nodes
2) similar types services 
3) Data context 
4) node density

clustering algos:

1 - k-means 
2 - HAC
3 - affinity assignment based on distance to cluster heads





1 service provider to the user
